six different elements that great games use to make movement more fun:
- Chaining moves
- Using the environment
- Nailing timing windows
- Building momentum
- Understanding trajectories (i.e grapple mechanics)
- Playing with physics

**coyote time** needs to be implemented.
movement should be easy to use, but hard to master.

Instead of punishing players who run out of lives, games can instead **reward** the players who manage to complete a sequence without having to retry too often.
*Crash Bandicoot 4* rewards a gem if the entire level is finished with fewer than three retries.
*Ori and the Blind Forest* checkpoints can be made by spending a certain type of currency.
