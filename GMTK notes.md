Celeste's assit mode:
![](assets/GMTK%20notes/images/celeste_assist_mode_show.png)  

Player should not be able to change game feel / story.
If easy levels are required then it needs to be made sure that the player is not ruining the story or the player needs to be notified.

![](assets/GMTK%20notes/images/heat_signature_permadeath_mode.png)

make follow up instead implementing assist mode / easy mode at the launch. (SOMA did this) or release side by side to emphasize disconnection.

### [How Cuphead's Bosses (Try to) Kill You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8T6Ul4aHTI&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit) ðŸ§¨

Variation of projectile path, size.
Player needs to learn about the boss and predict attack.

Bosses / Enemies inform in some sort to the player. (knowing as Telegraphing)

Build up the difficulties.
Bosses should be balanced to:

Player loses gold when dies.
Breaking checkpoints yields loots but player won't respawned to the checkpoint.

Shovel knight's game design:
- Take from multiple sources
- emulate what works
- modernise what doesn't
- give it a rose-tinted look

### [The 4 "P"s of DOOM's Amazing Combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ZsFT_eqXY&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit) ðŸ§¨
Enemies are introduced in phases.

Begs the question:
- which enemy to kill first (priority)

- recover resources (Doom zombies are mainly for resource purpose. they die quickly and spawn loots) (preservation)
- next player movement (position)

### [What Makes a Good Combat System?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X4fx-YncqA&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit) ðŸ§¨
Attacking: all players has base attack
- heavy attack would take time
  
Attacking frames category:
- Anticipation (dictates speed)
- Contact
- Recovery
![](assets/GMTK%20notes/images/light_attack_heavy_attack20221113204009.png)  

Dark souls don't have animation cancelling. Cannot interrupt with one move with another.
Attack range depends on design. (like Batman Arkham asylum has snapping, so attack range doesn't matter)

Defending:
- block
- dodge (two of these must be distinct)
In dark souls stamina gets reduced when performing defending

Parry/ counter:
- Don't make a wait-parry-counter game
- Don't make a alltime-slash-game

Enemy design:
make the player learn about enemies by making them distinct.
give heads up before enemy strike

Reward player in scoring system for successful combos and punish player for taking damage

Make intelligent enemy that learns player's move

Making an impact:

![](assets/GMTK%20notes/images/resident_evil20221113205817.png)  
- huge anticipation
- pause upon impact
- hefty recovery
- visual effects / blowing the screen / fireworks / enemy flashing red
